To Whom It May Concern,

I'm writing to recommend Chandan Thakur for your Data Science program. I'm Dev Narayan Mandal, President of Mithila Wildlife Trust (MWT), an NGO working on wildlife and environmental conservation in southern Nepal. Chandan worked with us from 2019 to 2023, and I got to know him well during this time.

Chandan started as a volunteer and quickly became a core member of our team. He led our snakebite awareness program, going to schools to teach kids about snakes, busting myths, and promoting conservation. His ability to explain complex ideas simply was impressive.

During COVID, Chandan played a big role in creating documentaries about how local people were struggling. Thanks to his work, we got donations from UK organizations to help these folks out. This showed me he can use his skills to make a real difference.

Chandan was also key in our reforestation project. He provided tech support and smart suggestions that really helped us work better with the community forest team. He's got a knack for using technology to solve real-world problems.

What stood out most was Chandan's love for the technical side of our work. He'd often analyze survey data we collected, finding patterns and insights we might have missed. He became our go-to person for anything tech-related, always ready to lend a hand and figure things out.

From what I've seen, Chandan has strong leadership skills. He can guide a team, communicate well, and isn't afraid to take charge when needed. These qualities, combined with his tech skills and data analysis abilities, make me believe he'd do great in a data science program.

Chandan has a unique mix of technical know-how and real-world experience. He's shown he can use data and tech to help people and the environment. I think these skills and experiences would be super valuable in the data science field.

Best regards,

Dev Narayan Mandal
President, Mithila Wildlife Trust
